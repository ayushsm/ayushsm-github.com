Nice to meet you! I'm a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, where I study Computer Science/Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering.

### <center>Background</center>
I come from San Ramon, CA where I lived all 18 years until really expanding my horizons and going to college 30 minutes away. Coming to Berkeley, I thought I was going to be a purely bio-related major but after my first year here, I realized that my dad was right all along and CS is the future... so I probably shouldn't have fallen asleep during all his CS lectures. Nevertheless, I'm currently taking numerous CS classes with a mix of some Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering classes on the side.

### <center>Hobbies and Activities</center>
As a kid and throughout high school I competed heavily in Speech and Debate, robotics, soccer, and baseball. I've also loved to read every since I was a child, much to my brother and his video game consoles' dismay. In college, I joined the badminton club, of which I'll be the president next year.
