description: Various Things I'm Reading
---
As of recently, I haven't really kept up with my reading habits all too well. However, I'm trying to get back into it so this is where I'll be keeping track of books I've read, am reading, or plan to read. Feel free to ask for any recommendations or tell me if there's any book/article/reading I ought to peruse. I'll read basically any book, whether it's science fiction, non-fiction, philosophy, or anything else.
